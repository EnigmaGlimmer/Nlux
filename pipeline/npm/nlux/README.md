## Vanilla JS üü® vs React JS ‚öõÔ∏è

This package `@nlux/nlux` is the Vanilla JS version of NLUX.
If you're looking for the React JS version, please check out
the [`@nlux/nlux-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlux/nlux-react) package.

## Get Started With NLUX and ChatGPT üöÄ

To get started with NLUX JS and ChatGPT, install the `@nlux/nlux` and `@nlux/openai` packages:

```sh
npm install @nlux/nlux @nlux/openai
```

Configure the OpenAI adapter with your API key:<br />
_(You can [get an API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) from your
OpenAI dashboard)_

```js
import {createConvoPit} from '@nlux/nlux';
import {createAdapter} from '@nlux/openai';

const chatGptAdapter = createAdapter('openai/gpt')
    .withApiKey('YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY')
    // üëá Instruct ChatGPT how to behave (optional)
    .withInitialSystemMessage(
        'Act as a Nobel Prize in Physics winner who is ' +
        'helping a PHD student in their research'
    );
```

Then render the **Nlux UI component** `Convo Pit` into your web page:

```js
const convoPit = createConvoPit()
    .withAdapter(chatGptAdapter)
    .withPromptBoxOptions({placeholder: 'Ask me anything about nuclear physics!'});

convoPit.mount(document.getElementById('chatroom-div'));
```

You should also [include the NLUX theme CSS file](#theme-file-and-css-) in your HTML page.

## Theme File and CSS üé®

You should include a **theme CSS file** into your HTML page.<br />
You can download and host the `Kensington Theme` CSS file
from [`@nlux/themes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlux/themes) or use the
CDN hosted version from below:

```jsx
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://themes.nlux.ai/v0.1.9-beta/kensington.css"/>
```

This CDN is provided for demo purposes only and it's not scalable.
Please download and host the theme files on your own for production use.
