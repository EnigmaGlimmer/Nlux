  your own adapter.

* **Syntax Highlighting** - Color and highlight code snippets in the response. **Copy and paste** code into your
  editor.

## Vanilla JS üü® vs React JS ‚öõÔ∏è

This package `@nlux/core` is the Vanilla JS version of NLUX.
If you're looking for the React JS version, please check
the [`@nlux/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlux/react) package.

## Get Started With NLUX and ChatGPT üöÄ

To get started with NLUX JS and ChatGPT, install the `@nlux/core` and `@nlux/openai` packages:

```sh
npm install @nlux/core @nlux/openai
```

Configure the OpenAI adapter with your API key:<br />
_(You can [get an API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-secret-api-key) from your
OpenAI dashboard)_

```js
import {createAiChat} from '@nlux/core';
import {createAdapter} from '@nlux/openai';

const chatGptAdapter = createAdapter()
    .withApiKey('YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY')
    // üëá Instruct ChatGPT how to behave (optional)
    .withSystemMessage(
        'Act as a Nobel Prize in Physics winner who is ' +
        'helping a PHD student in their research. Write short answers. Be funny!'
    );
```

Then render the `AiChat` component into your web page:

```js
const aiChat = createAiChat()
    .withAdapter(chatGptAdapter)
    .withConversationOptions({
        scrollWhenGenerating: true,
    })
    .withPromptBoxOptions({placeholder: 'Ask me anything about nuclear physics!'});

aiChat.mount(document.getElementById('root'));
```

You should also [include the NLUX theme CSS file](#theme-file-and-css-) in your HTML page.

## And The Result Is ‚ú®

A fully functional chatbot UI that can advise you on nuclear physics, coding, and even tell you a joke or two!

## Theme File and CSS üé®

You should include a **theme CSS file** into your HTML page.<br />
You can download and host the `Kensington Theme` CSS file
from [`@nlux/themes`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nlux/themes) or use the
CDN hosted version from below:

```jsx
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://themes.nlux.ai/v0.8.0/kensington.css"/>
