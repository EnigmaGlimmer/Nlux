## Get Started With NLUX React and ChatGPT ðŸš€

Install and import dependencies:

```sh
npm install @nlux/react @nlux/openai-react
```

Then include `<AiChat />` in your React app to get started.<br />
Use the `useAdapter` hook to configure an adapter for your LLM.

```jsx
import {AiChat} from '@nlux/react';
import {useAdapter} from '@nlux/openai-react';

const App = () => {
    const gptAdapter = useAdapter({
        apiKey: 'YOUR_OPEN_AI_API_KEY',
        // ðŸ‘‡ Instruct ChatGPT how to behave (optional)
        systemMessage:
            'Give sound, tailored financial advice. Explain concepts simply. When unsure, ask questions. ' +
            'Only recommend legal, ethical practices. Be friendly. Write concise answers under 5 sentences.'
    });

    return (
        <AiChat
            adapter={gptAdapter}
            promptBoxOptions={{
                placeholder: 'How can I help you today?'
            }}
        />
    );
}
```

## Theme File and CSS ðŸŽ¨

You should include a **theme CSS file** into your HTML page.<br />
The recommended way for React developers is to install `@nlux/themes`

```sh
npm install @nlux/themes
```

Then import the theme CSS file into your app or component as follows:

```jsx
import '@nlux/themes/nova.css';
```

This requires that your bundler is configured to load CSS files.
